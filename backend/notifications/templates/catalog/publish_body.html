  Your catalog
  "<a href="{{absolute_url('catalog/%s' % entity.key_urlsafe)}}">{{entity.name}}</a>"
  was successfully published.
</span><br/><br/>
<span>
  The catalog is set to expire on {{entity.discontinue_date|format_date}}
  when it will be automatically discontinued.

<span>
  Note that you can always manually discontinue your published catalog.

<span>
  Here are few reminders to be aware of:
</span><br/><br/>
<span>
  When created, a catalog initially assumes draft state and is not accessible to the general public.
  While in draft state, a catalog can be edited.
</span><br/><br/>
<span>
  A published catalog is accessible to the general public
  and can be shared and embedded to third party websites.
  With an exception of a product "Availability" field, a published catalog cannot be edited.
  However, a published catalog can be duplicated,
  and the duplicate is ready for editing.
</span><br/><br/>
<span>
  A discontinued catalog is not accessible to the general public
  and is eventually entirely removed from the Miraclestyle app.
  However, products of a discontinued catalog remain
  accessible for the 180 days to those who have purchased them.
  A discontinued catalog cannot be edited or duplicated.
