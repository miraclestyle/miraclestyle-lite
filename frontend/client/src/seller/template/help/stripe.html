                    When you input the "Secret key" value and save
                    the settings your data is sent over encrypted network connection
                    to our servers and, prior to being stored in our database,
                    the value is encrypted with a separate encryption key.
                    After that, the value is never returned from the servers,
                    and, therefore, remains invisible to you.
                    The value is used to charge a buyer's card on behalf
                    of your Stripe account when the buyer makes and purchase from you.
                    This practice adds another layer of security to
                    the value and protects it from malicious
                    data reads that may occur under circumstances such as
                    compromised sign-in identity account.
