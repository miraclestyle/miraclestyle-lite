    A sales order is a record of a transaction that occurs when you sell products or services to a buyer. 
    A sales order is automatically generated when a buyer initiates a payment on shopping cart checkout. 
    Unpaid sales orders aged more than 15 days are automatically deleted. 
    Your sales orders will appear ordered the way they were updated.
