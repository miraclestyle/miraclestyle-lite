    A sales order is a record of a transaction that occurs
    when you sell products or services to a buyer.
    Unpaid sales orders represent buyers'
    non-empty shopping carts.
    Unpaid sales orders aged more than
    15 days are automatically deleted.

    Here are few important guidelines to help you with your sales orders:
    </div>
    <div>
    - always make sure that you have received an accurate payment
    for a sales order marked as "Payment Completed"
    (you are solely responsible for any payment discrepancies
    that may occur in relation to your sales orders);
    </div>
    <div>
    - never ship products or deliver services for sales orders that were not paid
    (you are solely responsible for acting on your sales orders accordingly);
    </div>
    <div class="padding-bottom-8">
    - use sales order's messages box to communicate to a
    customer in the context of the order
    (you are solely responsible for the consequences
    of communicating with your customers).
