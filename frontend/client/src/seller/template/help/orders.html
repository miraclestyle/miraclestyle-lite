    A sales order is a record of a transaction that occurs
    when you sell products or services to a buyer.
    A sales order is automatically generated when a buyer
    initiates a payment on shopping cart checkout.
    Buyers' non-empty shopping carts aged more
    than 15 days are automatically emptied.

    Here are few important guidelines to help you with your sales orders:

    <div>
    - always make sure that you have received an accurate payment
    for an order marked as "Payment Completed"
    (you are solely responsible for any payment discrepancies
    that may occur in relation to your orders);
    </div>
    <div>
    - never ship products or deliver services for orders that were not paid
    (you are solely responsible for acting on your sales orders accordingly);
    </div>
    <div class="padding-bottom-8">
    - use order's messages box to communicate to a
    customer in the context of the order
    (you are solely responsible for the consequences
    of communicating with your customers).
