    Catalogs are an integral part of the Miraclestyle platform. A catalog is a collection of images that represent products or services to be sold. Each image can have multiple price tags attached. Each price tag is custom positioned on an image and links to product details. Product details contain information detailing characteristics of the product (or service) to be sold. Product is integrated with the shopping cart system to allow direct online purchases. When created, a catalog initially assumes draft state and is not accessible to the general public. While in draft state, a catalog can be edited. A published catalog is accessible to the general public and can be shared and embedded to third party websites. With an exception of a product "Availability" field, a published catalog cannot be edited. However, a published catalog can be duplicated, and the duplicate is ready for editing. A discontinued catalog is not accessible to the general public and is eventually entirely removed from the Miraclestyle. However, products of a discontinued catalog remain accessible for the 180 days to those who have purchased them. A discontinued catalog cannot be edited or duplicated. Your catalogs will appear ordered the way you have created them.
