  Images play perhaps the most important role in terms of
  sales and marketing success on the Miraclestyle app.
  That is why you should make sure your images look
  visually pleasing and impeccable while conveying desired information at the same time.
  Catalog images represent catalog pages arranged one next to another
  while the catalog is being viewed.
  Catalog images should be prepared in such manner as if they were
  to be printed pages of a mail-order catalog or magazine.

  Here are few important guidelines to help you with catalog images preparation:
  </div>
  <div>
  - the first image, the one at the upper left corner of the images grid, serves as the catalog cover;
  </div>
  <div>
  - the catalog cover should be of 1:1.3 aspect ratio (the system enforces this ratio);
  </div>
  <div>
  - maintain the same aspect ratio across all non-cover images (the system does not enforce this ratio);
  </div>
  <div>
  - images should be of overall high quality, preferably in Full HD resolution, for an optimal viewing experience on a variety of displays;
  </div>
  <div>
  - avoid uploading multiple images with the same contents, e.g. same product or combination of products presented from different angles;
  </div>
  <div>
  - an image should contain enough product details to make a product recognizable;
  </div>
  <div class="padding-bottom-8">
  - image contents should be optimized for viewing experience on small display sizes,
  i.e. make sure image contents are recognizable while viewed on small display sizes.
