                    Thank you for using Miraclestyle! We wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect,
                    how we use it, and what choices you have. Because we're an internet company,
                    some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we've tried our best to explain
                    things in a simple and clear way. We welcome your <a>questions and comments</a> on this policy.

                  <span class="subhead padding-bottom-20">We collect information in a few different ways:</span>
                  <span class="subhead bold padding-bottom-8">1. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it</span>
                  <span class="body1 padding-bottom-16">
                    When you sign up for or use our products, you voluntarily give us certain information.
                    This can include your email address you used to sign up, and any other information you provide us.
                    If you're using Miraclestyle on your mobile device, you can also choose to provide us with location data.
                    And if you choose to buy something on Miraclestyle, you provide us with payment information,
                    contact information (e.g., mailing address), and what you purchased.
                    If you buy something for someone else on Miraclestyle, you'd also provide us with their
                    shipping details and contact information. If you are selling something on Miraclestyle,
                    you provide us with your seller name (e.g., name of the brand, company, or store that you represent),
                    logo, contents, catalogs, products, what you sold, etc.
                  </span>
                  <span class="body1 padding-bottom-24">
                    You also may give us permission to access your information in other services.
                    For example, you may link your Facebook or Twitter account to Miraclestyle,
                    which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (like your friends or contacts).
                    The information we get from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies,
                    so be sure to check what those are.

                  <span class="body1 padding-bottom-16">
                    These days, whenever you use a website, mobile application, or other internet service,
                    there's certain information that almost always gets created and recorded automatically.
                    The same is true when you use our products. Here are some of the types of information we collect:
                  </span>

                      Log data. When you use Miraclestyle, our servers automatically record information ("log data"),
                      including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your
                      mobile app sends when you're using it. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address,
                      the address of the web pages you visited that had Miraclestyle features, browser type and settings,
                      the date and time of your request, how you used Miraclestyle, and cookie data.

                      Cookie data. Depending on how you're accessing our products,
                      we may use "cookies" (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website,
                      unique to your Miraclestyle account or your browser) or similar technologies to record log data.
                      When we use cookies, we may use "session" cookies (that last until you close your browser) or
                      "persistent" cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them).
                      For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other Miraclestyle
                      settings so you don't have to set them up every time you visit Miraclestyle.
                      Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Miraclestyle account
                      (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us),
                      and other cookies are not.

                      Device information. In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the

                      system you're using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data.
                      Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of
                      device you're using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available
                      depending on whether you're using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone.
                      To learn more about what information your device makes available to us,

                      which may include information like whether clicks on ads led to purchases or a list of criteria

                  <span class="body1 padding-bottom-16">
                    We use the information we collect to provide our products to you and make them better,
                    develop new products, and protect Miraclestyle and our users.
                    For example, we may log how often people use two different versions of a product,
                    which can help us understand which version is better.
                  </span>
                  <span class="body1 padding-bottom-16">
                    If you make a purchase on Miraclestyle, we'll save your purchase information.
                    If you provide us with contact information, we'll save it so that you can use
                    it the next time you want to buy something on Miraclestyle.

                      websites that have Miraclestyle features, we may suggest footwear sellers,
                      or catalogs that we think you might like.

                      For example, depending on your email notification settings,
                      we may send you weekly updates of recently published catalogs from sellers that you are following.
                      You can decide to stop getting these updates by updating your buyer settings
