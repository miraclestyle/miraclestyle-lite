For complete installation of the app, login as admin and run this path:

/api/install

Note that it will only create 100 records for locations and product categories if the application is not in development mode.

if install cannot be completed in single request, you can run it over taskqueue.

App is segmented in this way:

# default module
http://miraclestyle.appspot.com

# backend module
http://backend-dot-miraclestyle.appspot.com

Also, accessing path
http://miraclestyle.appspot.com/backend/*

Will point internally to the http://backend-dot-miraclestyle.appspot.com module configuration.

Endpoint path is:

/api/endpoint

live server:
http://miraclestyle.appspot.com/api/endpoint

direct access to module subdomian:
http://backend-dot-miraclestyle.appspot.com/api/endpoint

Deploying app:

sh deploy.sh arg1 arg2 arg3

arg1 => possible choices are "production" and "testing"
arg2 => possible choices are "all" "frontend" "backend"
arg3 => message for git commit
arg4 => possible choices are "misc"

the first argument changes app.yaml to production or testing

the second argument deploys to the frontend, backend or both

the third argument will be used as a commit message

the fourth argument will also upload dispatch, taskqueue entries, indexes

Example:

sh deploy.sh production all "fix stuff" misc - will deploy to production backend and frontend along with other .yaml files
sh deploy.sh testing all "fix stuff again" misc - will deploy to testing backend and frontend along with other .yaml files


Along with other things, the script will commit to bitbucket and perform build that will compile all static files accordingly.

PS: It won't work if you do not have appcfg.py python node executables
